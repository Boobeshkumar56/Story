About Me
I, Mithu Ashwin from Coonoor, Nilgiris. My journey with photography began in 2013-2014 when I first picked up a DSLR camera during my college days in Coimbatore. Under the guidance of Rodney Simon, a mentor from church, I started learning and developing my skills. For me, photography is about finding beauty in every moment and connecting with the world through my lens – it's not just a job, but a way to preserve memories and tell stories..


My Journey


Early Days: I began by lending cameras from Mathew Jones and did my first paid shoot in June 2016. My first wedding exposure shoot was in July 2016, which marked the beginning of my professional photography journey.


Growth: In 2018, I got my first wedding booking in Coimbatore, and I started renting cameras to fulfill my bookings. Owning my first camera, a Nikon D7200, in 2019 was a turning point in my career. My skills started to develop, and I began to gain recognition as a photographer in Coonoor and the Nilgiris.


Upgrading: In 2021, I invested in a full-frame camera, the Nikon D780, which became my workhorse. Recently, I upgraded to the Nikon Z6iii, which has taken my work to new heights by delivering exceptional quality.


Experience and Expertise: Throughout my professional photography journey, I've constantly grown and leveled up my skills to deliver high-quality work with diligence. From renting cameras to owning them, the journey has been incredible. I'm grateful to be considered one of the photographers in my field, and I'm excited to continue capturing life's precious moments.
